## Project: fjscomm	
Flask-Javascript communication.  (My terminology.)

I'm starting to learn "Python-API-endpoint" terminology.
I don't want to wrongly use jargon and sound like a noob.

Creating RESTful APIs using Python and Flask
Consuming (?) JSON APIs from within a Flask app.
Return JSON to the browser, which updates an HTML canvas.

in vscode, if you do a split view, you get preview.
    View/editor layout/single to undo split view, or just close the preview tab.
```

## Steps So Far:

0.  git config --global   etc

0.  local:  create folder with files.   fpj.  (fjscomm got weird...)

0.  github:  click new for new repository   fpj

0.  local:
```
    cd fpj
    git init
    git add -A
    git commit -m "first commmit"
         now follow instructions from the github "new repo" step:
         git remote add origin https-----/fpj.git
         git branch -M main
         git push -u origin main
```

0. local:
```
I made edits, then commit -a -m "___", then git push.
and the changes were on github.
But I couldn't edit the file there. Don't know why not.
```
