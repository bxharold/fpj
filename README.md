## Project: fjscomm	   This is a dup, "fpj" because I got confused at mac local.

I think the issue is MOL that renaming a folder tells git that there was a change;
maybe the only way to delete the local repo is to really delete the folder.  
Altho I thought removing the .git subfolder was enough...

Flask-Javascript communication.  (My terminology.)

I'm starting to learn "Python-API-endpoint" terminology.
I don't want to wrongly use jargon and sound like a noob.

## Steps So Far:

0.  git config --global   etc

0.  local:  create folder with files.   fpj.  (fjscomm got weird...)

0.  github:  click new for new repository   fpj

0.  local:
```
    cd fpj
    git init
    git add -A
    git commit -m "first commmit"
         now follow instructions from the github "new repo" step:
         git remote add origin https-----/fpj.git
         git branch -M main
         git push -u origin main
```

0. local:
```
I made edits, then commit -a -m "___", then git push.
and the changes were on github.
But I couldn't edit the file there. Don't know why not.
```

2 things.  This time, I can edit the file.  The numbered list started at 0 again.
